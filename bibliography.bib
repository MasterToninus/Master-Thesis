abstract = {How to give a natural geometric definition of a covariant Poisson bracket in classical field theory has for a long time been an open problem - as testified by the extensive literature on "multisymplectic Poisson brackets", together with the fact that all these proposals suffer from serious defects. On the other hand, the functional approach does provide a good candidate which has come to be known as the Peierls - De Witt bracket and whose construction in a geometrical setting is now well understood. Here, we show how the basic "multisymplectic Poisson bracket" already proposed in the 1970s can be derived from the Peierls - De Witt bracket, applied to a special class of functionals. This relation allows to trace back most (if not all) of the problems encountered in the past to ambiguities (the relation between differential forms on multiphase space and the functionals they define is not one-to-one) and also to the fact that this class of functionals does not form a Poisson subalgebra.},

@article{Khavkine2014,
abstract = {It is well known that both the symplectic structure and the Poisson brackets of classical field theory can be constructed directly from the Lagrangian in a covariant way, without passing through the non-covariant canonical Hamiltonian formalism. This is true even in the presence of constraints and gauge symmetries. These constructions go under the names of the covariant phase space formalism and the Peierls bracket. We review both of them, paying more careful attention, than usual, to the precise mathematical hypotheses that they require, illustrating them in examples. Also an extensive historical overview of the development of these constructions is provided. The novel aspect of our presentation is a significant expansion and generalization of an elegant and quite recent argument by Forger \& Romero showing the equivalence between the resulting symplectic and Poisson structures without passing through the canonical Hamiltonian formalism as an intermediary. We generalize it to cover theories with constraints and gauge symmetries and formulate precise sufficient conditions under which the argument holds. These conditions include a local condition on the equations of motion that we call hyperbolizability, and some global conditions of cohomological nature. The details of our presentation may shed some light on subtle questions related to the Poisson structure of gauge theories and their quantization.},

@article{Marolf1993,
abstract = {We first extend the Peierls algebra of gauge invariant functions from the space \$\{\backslash cal S\}\$ of classical solutions to the space \$\{\backslash cal H\}\$ of histories used in path integration and some studies of decoherence. We then show that it may be generalized in a number of ways to act on gauge dependent functions on \$\{\backslash cal H\}\$. These generalizations (referred to as class I) depend on the choice of an ``invariance breaking term," which must be chosen carefully so that the gauge dependent algebra is a Lie algebra. Another class of invariance breaking terms is also found that leads to an algebra of gauge dependent functions, but only on the space \$\{\backslash cal S\}\$ of solutions. By the proper choice of invariance breaking term, we can construct a generalized Peierls algebra that agrees with any gauge dependent algebra constructed through canonical or gauge fixing methods, as well as Feynman and Landau ``gauge." Thus, generalized Peierls algebras present a unified description of these techniques. We study the properties of generalized Peierls algebras and their pull backs to spaces of partial solutions and find that they may posses constraints similar to the canonical case. Such constraints are always first class, and quantization may proceed accordingly.},
