# Master Thesis
Main file: MasterThesis_Fancy.tex

## Requirements
* Latex-Theorem
* Math-Symbols-List
*

## Notes
* The repo is very heavy (~50MB) due to the presence of too many raw file in the history.
* The dependencies from other latex file are implemented awfully! I've hardcoded in the source files relatived path to some file found in different repositories!

# Todo
- [ ] squash significant commit together to
- [ ] deal with the dependency problem in a more professional way.
- [ ] (big one): find an efficient way to encapsulate latex code. e.g. store the definitions in a database.
